# Loan Granting

We have access to a specific bank loan data. We have data about all loans asked to the bank,
whether the bank decided to grant it and, finally, whether the borrower managed to repay it. We
also have info about the borrower at the moment she is asking for the loan.

You have to come up with a better strategy to grant loans. Specifically you should:

Build a model which is better than the bank model. For simplicity, assume that:

If you grant the loan and the it doesn't get repaid, you lose 1

If you grant the loan and the it does get repaid, you gain 1

If you don't grant the loan, you gain 0

Using the rules above, compare bank profitability vs your model profitability

Describe the impact of the most important variables on the prediction. Also, focus on the
variable "is_employed", which describes whether the borrower is employed when she
asks for the loan. How does this variable impact the model? Explain why

Are there any other variables, not in the data provided, that you'd have liked to include in
the model?
